Microblaze 16x2 LCD Driver
--------------------------

This EDK project is based on the tutorial by FPGA Developer:

http://www.fpgadeveloper.com/2008/10/microblaze-16x2-lcd-driver.html

It allows you to write text on a 16x2 character LCD by using a
simple Microblaze program written in C.

You are free to use this code in your own designs, but please 
acknowledge my work by leaving a link to the website. Thanks.
